# Advanced Lab 2: Final Project
## Katie Hermanson
##### Description: My final project for Advanced Lab 2 consists of analyzing the nature of dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and unclassified satellites within the Milky Way galaxy, the Andromeda galaxy, and others within the local field up to ~3 Mpc. Specifically, I will look at their dynamical mass-to-light ratios as a measure of their dark matter content. I will then compare observed local volume dwarfs to simulated data of dwarfs created by the EDGE (Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy's Edge) hydrodynamical simulation suite. This project involves various astrophysical concepts, as well as using observed astrophysical data and simulated data. I will use Python for data analysis, error analysis, and visualization.
